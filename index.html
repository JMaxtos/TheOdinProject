            <p>I'm <a href="https://github.com/JMaxtos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">JMaxtos</a> and this is my repository for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/"rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a> projects. Here you can see my solutions for the projects I've realised during the course.</p>

            <h2>Foundations Course</h2>
            <p>This course is about mastering the essential tools and skills for web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git workflows, and more. It's designed to provide a strong foundation for building real, functional websites and launching your career in web development. You can see my projects clicking on the titles below</p>
            <ul class="projectlist">
                <li><a href="odin-recipes/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recipes</a></li>
                <p> A basic recipe website. The site will feature a main index page with links to several recipes. While the final result might not be visually stunning yet, the focus is on strengthening your HTML skills. I might add some CSS later</p>
                <li><a href="landing-page/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Landing Page</a></li>
                <p>A complete landing page based on a provided design. Using the HTML, CSS, and Flexbox skills I learned in this part of the course, I created a unique landing page that is more visually stunning than the previous project (for now).</p>
